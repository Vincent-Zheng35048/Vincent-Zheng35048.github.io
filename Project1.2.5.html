<p>This is my second project at Worcester Technical Highschool.</p>
<p>User Story: User Story: A businessman is very busy every day. He has many tasks throughout his day that he can’t keep up with and forgets a bunch of them. He needs help by getting an app that reminds him of the tasks he needs to do. He wants to be able to type tasks into a list that will be displayed for him to see. He also wants to be able to add a time he needs to do a task by. He also wants to be able to delete each individual task from the list and clear all of the tasks as well.
</p>
<br>
<p>The Apps Algorithms:</p>
<ul>
 <li> 1.AddAndDisplayTask button is clicked, if time text or the task text is empty, then a message will pop up saying that you must enter something in the textboxes. Otherwise, the variable called TaskNumber will be incremented by 1, the procedure named StoreAndDisplayData will be called, and the text of both textboxes will be set to an empty string.</li>
 
 <li>2.When ClearButton is clicked a notifier message will pop up which asks if you want to delete all of the data in the database or not.</li>
 
 <li>3.After you choose yes or no when the ClearDataNotifier pops up, then if you chose yes, all data in the database will delete and the TaskNumber variable will be set to 0.</li>
 
 <li>4.StoreDisplayData procedure: Stores the task text and the time text into the database and transfers it into a list as well as display the data on the list view.</li>
 
 <li>5.When you select the date from the date picker component then it will display the date you chose on a label.</li>
 
 <li>6.When you select a task on the list view, a notifier message will pop up saying whether you want to delete the task or not.</li>
 
 <li>7.After you choose whether you want to delete a certain task, if you choose yes, then that task will be deleted from the listview and cleared from the database.</li>
 
 <li>8.When Screen1 initializes, a don’t forget sound will play</li>
 
 <li>9.When the next page button is clicked, the reflections screen will be initialized.</li>
 
 <li>10.When the clickme button is clicked, you will be taken to Screen1 (main screen)</li>

 <li>11.When the go_back_to_main_screen button is clicked, you will be taken back to Screen1 (main screen)</li>
</ul>
